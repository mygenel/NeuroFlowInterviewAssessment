What would I do differently?

The first thing that I would do differently is to improve the security of the program.
Currently all information is being sent openly and all user information is being stored as plain text as well.
A suitable encryption algorithm should be chosen and all information that is being sent and stored
should be encrypted to provide security to the users. Secondly, all the information that is being stored
should be stored in a database when more users are supposed to use this application.
In a complete application, other requirements would also come in to play, such as the user being able to log out, and new users being able to register and many more.
Therefore, the way the user information is being stored and checked will be a lot different than what it is currently.
As other requirements and restrictions come in to play, the development strategy may vary.

The technology I would choose to use will depend on many factors. Therefore, my choice will change according to the specific situation, but 
I might have still used Python for developing this API, due to its plethora of libraries.

The most important thing that I would pay attention to during the development and testing process, if this was a product and not an assessment,
I would pay a lot more attention to do load testing and the system being able to handle several requests.
